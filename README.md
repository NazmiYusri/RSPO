## Project Title
RSPO Concessions Mapping & Certification Analysis – Malaysia

## Project Goal
To develop a visual and spatial analysis product using QGIS that maps and quantifies the distribution of RSPO-certified and uncertified oil palm concessions across Malaysia. 
The goal is to support environmental planning, sustainability tracking, and informed decision-making for ecological offset site selection, especially in the context of industrial and renewable energy development.

The project highlights state-level certification trends (e.g., Johor, Perak, Sabah), assesses the ecological impact through spatial coverage, and communicates findings through cartographic visuals and statistical charts.

## Tools Used
QGIS, Python (for spatial calculations), Excel (for tabular data management), Adobe Illustrator (for layout refinement)

## Data Overview
• RSPO concession shapefiles (Certified & Uncertified)
• State boundaries (Johor, Perak, Sabah)
• RSPO estate data with area (km²)
• Certification status and estate ownership
• Source: Global Forest Watch, RSPO

## Key KPIs and Metrics
• % of RSPO Certified vs. Uncertified Areas by State
• Total RSPO Area (Certified + Uncertified) per region
• Area (km²) of Largest RSPO Certified Estates (by company)
• National RSPO Certification Rate (Malaysia-wide)

## The Output Result
<img src="equipmentreview_dashboard.png">
Highlights:
• Malaysia Total: 68% RSPO Certified, 32% Uncertified (of ~18,200 km²)
• Perak: 95.7% Certified
• Johor: 93.1% Certified
• Sabah: Nearly balanced, 47.1% Certified vs. 52.9% Uncertified

Top Estates: Sime Darby (121 km²), FGV (93 km²)

## Business Impact
This geospatial output provides policymakers, renewable energy developers, and environmental consultants with a clear picture of RSPO coverage in Malaysia. It assists in:
• Site selection for ecological offset zones
• Identifying certification gaps in key oil palm regions
• Supporting compliance reporting and sustainability tracking
• Driving stakeholder engagement through data-driven visuals
